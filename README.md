# mc-proxy

I don't really use this much, more of a proof of concept.

It can:
1. Create world folders.
2. Run jars on preconfigured folders.
3. Proxy different servers on the same port. Useful if you want to maybe switch between worlds faster or come up with your own use-case, idk.

Some entry points:

Create a world: `npm run worldgen`<br />
Start a server: `npm run mc`<br />
Start proxy: `npm run proxy`<br />
